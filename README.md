# human-gazebo

This repository contains the human gazebo models that are used with [Human Dynamics Estimation](https://github.com/robotology/human-dynamics-estimation) software suite.  The files are generated using [xsens motion capture](https://www.xsens.com/) data and [mvnx-to-urdf](https://github.com/ami-iit/mvnx-to-urdf). The human model links are made of several simple rigid bodies as shown in the figure below:

The measurements of each of the human subject are available from the table. Please refer to the human subject data pdf file to know how these measurements are taken. The urdf models are generated from xsens mvnx file generated through xsens mvn studio software suite.  The code to generate the model is available [here](https://github.com/dic-iit/human-model-generator)

Currently, the legacy directory contains files related to joint motor control boards based on [gazebo-yarp-plugins](https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins) and other configuration files needed to control the human joints.
